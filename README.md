FLUFFS
==========
##Work in progress!

FLUFFS is an enterprise scale file interrogation, tracking and information discovery solution for Windows networks.

Its purpose is to build a large index of files within a shared file system, track them to establish the frequency with which they are updated (if at all), and allow interrogation of the contents of the common Office file formats for matching keywords, phrases and regular expressions.
